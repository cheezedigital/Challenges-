 => true
so, yea, highline was designed to implement input and output with low-level methods like gets and puts.
did i forget to mention it generates requesting data from the user without actually having to check the code for
errors. highline simplifies common console interaction.

gem install highline
require 'highline' in irb and wait for prompt to return true.
if you do highline import, then it give you the global methods to make it easy to use from the top level.
